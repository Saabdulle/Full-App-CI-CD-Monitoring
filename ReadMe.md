## Prerequisites

- **Pulumi CLI:** Install the Pulumi CLI on your machine. Instructions can be found [here](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/).

- **Cloud Provider Account:** Set up an account with your chosen cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.). Configure your credentials to authenticate Pulumi with your cloud account.

### Install Node.js

If you haven't installed Node.js yet, download and install it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). npm comes bundled with Node.js, so installing Node.js will automatically install npm.

### Initialize npm in your Pulumi project

Run the following command to initialize npm for your Pulumi project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

This command initializes a new `package.json` file in your project directory with default values (-y flag skips the interactive setup).

### Install Pulumi as a Dependency

Pulumi should be added as a dependency to your project. Install the Pulumi CLI as a development dependency by running:

For JavaScript/TypeScript projects:
```bash
npm install @pulumi/pulumi --save-dev
```

For other languages (Python, Go, etc.), use the appropriate Pulumi SDK package instead of `@pulumi/pulumi`.

### Install Required Pulumi Providers

For the AWS provider (based on your provided code snippets), install the `@pulumi/aws` package:

```bash
npm install @pulumi/aws
```

If you're using other cloud providers (Azure, GCP, etc.) or additional Pulumi packages for different services, install their respective Pulumi provider packages as needed.

## Module Overview

### VPC Creation

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using the AWS provider in Pulumi. It configures a VPC with both public and private subnets, specifying the CIDR blocks for each subnet, enabling DNS hostnames, and setting specific tags for identification.

### RDS Instance

Amazon RDS database instance using the AWS provider in Pulumi. It defines an RDS instance with parameters such as instance class, allocated storage, database name, engine type and version, authentication details, and security group associations.

### EKS Cluster

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster using the AWS provider in Pulumi. It sets up an EKS cluster with a specified name, role, and VPC configuration to define its networking settings.

### Node Group for EKS

Node group within an existing EKS cluster using the AWS provider in Pulumi. It configures scaling options, networking, instance types, and naming for the nodes.

### Security Group

AWS security group using Pulumi's AWS provider. It configures inbound and outbound rules for different ports, allowing or restricting access based on specified CIDR blocks. It also incorporates IP whitelisting for specific ports by restricting access to designated IP addresses.
